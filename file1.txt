Basically, a pipeline splits your data into smaller chunks and processes each chunk independently.
Because of this, it is highly scalable and can process tremendous amount of data with many workers running in parallel across several machines.
We can use Java, Python, Go and Scala to write our pipelines.
This series of tutorial will show you how to write your pipelines in Java and execute them locally using DirectRunner as well as with other runners.
The concepts are similar even if you use different programming language. I highly recommend you to check out their documentation for learning core concepts of Beam.

Apache Beam is a relatively new framework that provides both batch and stream processing of data in any execution engine.
In Beam you write what are called pipelines, and run those pipelines in any of the runners. Beam supports many runners such as:
